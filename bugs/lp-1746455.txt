=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
Base image hostname of (ubuntu) sent out with every dhcp request for juju-deployed units in vsphere.
As a result certain bundle deployments such as kubernetes break during install because in DDNS environments which update the hostname of ubuntu to each new unit's DHCPREQUEST.


[Test Case]
The flow:
 a) juju add-unit ubuntu
 b) upgrade to xenial-proposed cloud-init
 c) set hostname to something non-juju
 d) set re-run cloud-init clean
 e)  tail /var/log/syslog on MAAS server to ensure the first DHCPREQUEST matches the juju-hostname instead of the non-juju 'original' hostname

[Regression Potential]
